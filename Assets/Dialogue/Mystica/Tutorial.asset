  - Mage!
  - You're in a lot of trouble this time, you followed a butterfly here? Just to
    be buried in a cave??
  - '*sigh*, Alright, as your "guardian angel" I guess I have to help you again..'
  - Go right, just... Be aware of anything that moves in there, you'll find your
    way out eventually
  - I hope....
